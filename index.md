### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
##### The first week of bootcamp exceeded my expectations in both workload and excitement. We dove right in to an ocean of material! 
### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
##### I am excited to learn more about back end development, as it is honestly the part of web development that is a bit scary to me. 
### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
##### I would say that I am much nerdier than I may appear, and it often surprises people. I'm a big fan of things like video games, anime, fantasy novels, and DnD, I've even been a DM, *dungeon master*, for a few campaigns. Most of all, I love traveling and experiencing new cultures (and learning their language).
